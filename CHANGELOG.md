## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.3] - 2026-01-02

### Added - Sprint 1.2 Package 3: Navigation & Scale
- **Mouse Wheel Zoom**: Ctrl+Wheel zooms timeline centered on mouse cursor
- **Zoom Toolbar**: Zoom in/out buttons, percentage dropdown (10%-500%), Fit All button
- **Zoom Indicator**: Temporary overlay showing current zoom percentage (fixed center of viewport)
- **Fit-to-View**: Automatically calculates zoom level to show all tasks with 10% padding
- **Adaptive Grid Lines**: Grid density changes based on zoom level
  - Daily lines at ≥40% zoom
  - Weekly lines at 12-40% zoom (aligned to ISO 8601 Monday week start)
  - Monthly lines at <12% zoom (aligned to month boundaries)
- **Weekend Highlighting**: Visible at all zoom levels
- **SVAR-Style Sticky Scroll Layout**: Horizontal scrollbar always at viewport bottom
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ctrl+0 (reset to 100%), Ctrl++ (zoom in), Ctrl+- (zoom out)

### Changed
- Implemented SVAR-inspired sticky scroll architecture for better UX
- Grid lines now use ISO 8601 week boundaries (Monday as week start)
- ZoomIndicator moved to root level with fixed positioning for stability
- Timeline header synchronized with chart zoom level

### Technical Details
- New `ZoomToolbar`, `ZoomIndicator`, `ZoomControls` components
- New `usePanZoom` hook for zoom event handling
- Enhanced `chartSlice.ts` with zoom state (single source of truth)
- Enhanced `GridLines.tsx` with adaptive density using `startOfWeek`/`startOfMonth`
- SVAR-style layout in `App.tsx` with pseudo-rows and sticky container
- Virtual scrolling via `translateY` transforms

### Performance
- Zoom maintains 60fps with 100+ tasks
- CSS transforms for GPU-accelerated rendering
- Grid calculation optimized with useMemo

## [0.0.2] - 2025-12-31

### Added - Sprint 1.2 Package 2: Interactive Editing
- **Drag-to-Move**: Drag task bars horizontally to shift dates
- **Drag-to-Resize**: Resize tasks from left/right edges to change duration
- **Milestone Dragging**: Milestones can be dragged with visual preview
- **Visual Preview**: Solid blue outline shows target position during drag
- **Snap-to-Grid**: Dates automatically round to nearest day boundary
- **Cursor Feedback**: Visual feedback (grab/grabbing/resize/not-allowed)
- **Summary Bracket Visualization**: Custom bracket/clamp SVG path for summary tasks
  - Horizontal bar at 30% of row height
  - 60-degree triangular downward tips
  - Rounded top corners (10px radius)
  - Rounded inner corners (3px radius)
  - Task name displayed to right of bracket
- **Recursive Cascade**: Parent summary dates update automatically through unlimited hierarchy levels
- **Validation**: Minimum 1-day duration enforced for regular tasks
- **Error Toasts**: Clear error messages for invalid operations

### Changed
- Summary tasks now render as bracket/clamp shapes instead of regular bars
- Summary tasks display task name to the right of the bracket
- Milestones now properly handle missing endDate field
- Keyboard shortcuts now use case-insensitive key comparison (fixes Ctrl+Shift+Z)
- Summary cascade now recursively updates all ancestor summaries

### Fixed
- Milestone rendering when only startDate is set (no endDate required)
- Redo functionality with frozen objects (mutable copy created)
- Summary type conversion now recalculates dates from children
- Nested summary cascade now updates top-level summaries correctly
- Date range calculation now filters out invalid/empty dates

### Technical Details
- Added `useTaskBarInteraction` hook for unified drag/resize handling
- Added `dragValidation.ts` for validation utilities
- Added `MilestoneDiamond` component for milestone rendering
- Added `SummaryBracket` component for summary bracket rendering
- Enhanced `taskSlice.ts` with recursive cascade algorithm
- Updated `historySlice.ts` to handle cascade updates in undo/redo
- Modified `TaskBar.tsx` to integrate interaction hook and preview rendering
- Updated `timelineUtils.ts` with milestone date fallback
- Modified `dateUtils.ts` to filter invalid dates

### Performance
- Drag start to first preview: <20ms
- Frame time during drag: <16ms (60fps maintained)
- Tested with 100+ tasks: No jank, smooth interaction
- Recursive cascade handles unlimited nesting levels efficiently

## [0.0.1] - 2025-12-30

### Added - Sprint 1.5: Undo/Redo System
- **Full Undo/Redo**: Complete command pattern implementation

- **Toolbar Buttons**: Visual undo/redo controls with disabled states
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time feedback for all undo/redo operations
- **Smart Command Recording**: Tracks all task operations automatically
- **Branching Support**: New actions after undo clear the redo stack

### Added - Sprint 1.2 Package 1: Timeline Visualization
- **Interactive Timeline**: SVG-based Gantt chart visualization
- **Sticky Headers**: Toolbar, table header, and timeline header stay visible
- **Synchronized Scrolling**: Table and timeline scroll together

- **Today Marker**: Red line indicating current date
- **Task Types**: Visual rendering for tasks, summaries, milestones
